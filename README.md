# Simple init script for Epicodus Students

### Author: _Cory Olson_

#### Purpose

Sets up an Epicodus Mac with an SSH key and modifies terminal with colors and git branch

#### Usage
- Clone the repository to a local directory
- Make init.sh executable
- Type './init.sh' at the command prompt
- Follow the prompts to create an ssh key

Once you have returned to the command prompt, your prompt should show colors on the command line. If you are in a git repository, the prompt should also show the name of the branch in gold.

If you do not see a colored prompt, type the following:

  source ~/.bash_profile
